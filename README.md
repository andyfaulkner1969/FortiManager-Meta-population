# FortiManager-Meta-population
This repository is use the JSON to both create and populate meta fields.

These scripts need a lot of work done to them.  It's on my todo list.

These scripts came from a need to first create a list of meta fields on the Fortimanager then have the ablility
to populate them from an excel speadsheet.  There is an example spreadsheet.  

You will need to put your FMG relivant information and the path to your spreadsheet.

Also I am using the hostname as the device name on the FMG.  This can be modified to your needs.
